## Comment
This chapter primarily discusses Linus and his first computer. Despite his young age and the simplicity of the computer, he did engage with it and had a great time. What struck me as particularly surprising is that he was able to program at such a young age, and what he was operating was assembly language rather than a high-level programming language. This makes it far more challenging to learn. Unquestionably, he displayed a natural talent for computer programming, haha.

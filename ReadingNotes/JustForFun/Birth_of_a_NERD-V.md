So young and already sucha a health food nut. 

In fact, the only time I brought girls home was when they wanted to be tutored. 

We did all that, and I guess that I had fun, but I dont't remember anything special about it. But ask me about the specs on my 68008-chip machine and I can rattle them off with total recall. 

Generally speaking, I was better in school than my sister, Sara, who was more sociable, easier to look at, nicer,to people--and, I should add, has been hired to translate this book into Swedish. 

## Comment
This chapter chronicles Linus's three years of high school life, highlighting his distinct academic inclinations. He explicitly identifies as mathematically gifted, excelling in mathematics and physics while struggling with memorization-intensive subjects. Notably, his passion for programming persisted undiminished during this period, maintaining the technical focus established in earlier life stages.  

The narrative offers limited substantive developments beyond reinforcing Linus's established intellectual profile. As such, this section primarily serves as transitional material rather than introducing significant new dimensions to his story.

In fact, some people suggest that the major reason for the required army duty is to give Finnish men something to talk about over beer for as long as they live. They all have something in miserable in common. They hated the Army, but they're happy to talk about it afterward. 

The club was comprised of students in the hard sciences, such as physics and chemistry. Translation: It's all guys. 

And there was ample time for it to happen: I studied at the university for eight years, emerging with nothing more than a mere master's degree. 

Well, everybody knows in general that the army isn't going to be fun. It's something perpetutated by everybody being there. But I didn't have a clear idea what it would be like, and that made me nervous. It's sort of how I feel about having people read this book. 

## Comment
This chapter explores Linus's university years, divided between military service and club activities. Three key aspects warrant discussion:  

First, the conspicuous absence of women in STEM fields resonates deeply. As Linus notes, his science club was exclusively male—a phenomenon familiar in China's technical education. This shared experience creates immediate relatability, demonstrating the author's remarkable skill in establishing reader connection through universal academic observations.  

Second, the depiction of compulsory military service proves particularly impactful. Linus served as a controller and patrol officer, mirroring China's cultural perspective on military duty. Though not mandatory in China, the saying "those who serve regret three years, but those who don't will regret a lifetime" reflects similar societal values. This parallel further deepens reader engagement with the narrative.  

Finally, Linus's critique of formal education strikes a chord. His dismissal of eight years yielding "nothing more than a mere master's degree" echoes a widespread sentiment: truly applicable workplace knowledge typically comes from self-directed learning and digital resources, not traditional classrooms. This candid assessment reinforces his authentic, pragmatic worldview.

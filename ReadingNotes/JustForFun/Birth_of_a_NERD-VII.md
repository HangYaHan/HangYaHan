## Comment
This concise chapter focuses on three quintessentially Finnish cultural pillars: saunas, silence, and education.  

Initially, I mistakenly assumed "saunas" referred to a type of sausage—a humorous misunderstanding that persisted until research clarified it as Finland's national obsession. My own sauna experiences, though distant memories, recall sweltering heat and social nudity. The author's claim that Finns prioritize saunas over houses underscores their cultural significance.  

The discussion of Finnish silence reveals a paradox: their renowned reticence in face-to-face interactions created perfect conditions for mobile phone adoption. This cultural trait, born from stoic endurance of harsh winters and foreign domination, unexpectedly positioned Finland as a tech pioneer.  

Most astonishing is Finland's world-leading literacy rate, achieved through extended schooling. This educational emphasis, coupled with the previous observations, paints a fascinating portrait of a society that values quiet competence—a trait clearly reflected in Linus's own character.

## Sentences
**Depending on the computer, it was either a rudimentary format or a slightly more advanced one.**  
译文：根据计算机型号的不同，它采用的基本格式可能是初级的，也可能是稍高级的。

**I knew it by heart back then.**  
译文：那时我对它了如指掌。

**I had enjoyed and sometimes I added enhancements. But mostly they were not better...**  
译文：我很享受这个过程，有时还会添加改进功能。但多数改进并非优化：只是更好的机器，而非更好的概念。

**There was a positive side effect to this pain-in-the-neck...**  
译文：这个麻烦事产生了意外好处：当我考虑处理掉机器时，决定卖掉外设——包括因无法忍受微型驱动器而购买的真实硬盘，以及我的扩展内存。

One of the problems was that the program had been written in assembly language. That meant that if you made the slighest, slightest mistake copying it from the magazine, it wouldn't work.

If the lowest-cost computer is much more expensive, a company isn't going to be able to sell many of them.

Both were written in assembly language, which is incredibly stupid by today's standards. It's complicated and time consuming -- I'd guess it takes a hundred times longer to solve a problem in assembly language than in the C language, for example. which was available at the time.

Games used to be fairly simple. These days, programming is actually a fairly small part of any game. There's music, thers's the plot. If you compare it to making a movie, the programming component is just the camera work.

## Comment
This pivotal chapter transitions from Linus's childhood to the technical genesis of operating systems, marked by increased depth and specialized knowledge requirements. The narrative reveals how PCs—rare commercial products even in relatively advanced Europe—demanded significant financial sacrifice. Linus's part-time work to afford his second computer highlights a universal truth: the struggle to attain meaningful goals often proves more transformative than the possession itself, as humans rapidly acclimate to acquired achievements.

Linus's dual focus on driver development and game programming established critical foundations for Linux's future architecture. His high school achievements—writing hardware drivers without references or technical support—remain astonishing, showcasing both innate genius and relentless curiosity. Crucially, his iterative enhancement process ("sometimes I added enhancements") exemplifies deep learning: by modifying code to observe outcomes, he gained the granular understanding necessary for true innovation.

The chapter resonates personally regarding game development aspirations. Modern games demand multidisciplinary expertise far beyond programming—music composition, narrative design, and balancing mechanics—making solo development daunting. My own "Game of Life" project revealed similar revelations: deceptively simple cellular automata rules yield profound emergent complexity, embodying the elegance Linus admired in minimalist systems. Such passion projects, while rarely commercially viable, offer unparalleled learning opportunities that mirror Linus's foundational tinkering.

Not that I had been up on the development.

I'm completely uninterested in the thing that he's the best in the world at, And he's not interested in the thing that maybe I'm the best in the world at. I couldn't give him
advice in business and he couldn't give me advice in technology."

Most acclaimed technologists - even most of the unacclaimed ones - have this immediate desire to let you know how brilliant they are. And that they are critical players in a mission that is far more important, than,  say, the struggle for world peace.

## Comment
This interstitial chapter details the author's initial encounter with Linus and the genesis of this biography. Remarkably, despite holding substantial stock in Linux-utilizing companies that made him extremely wealthy, Linus inhabits a cramped duplex rather than a palatial estate like Bill Gates. This stark contrast vividly reveals his authentic character—a technologist driven purely by passion rather than material accumulation. He consciously rejects luxury, maintaining the lifestyle of an ordinary programmer: hand-raising his children, drinking cola, and wearing unremarkable clothes. Crucially, he avoids the grandiose abstractions typical of business magnates and capitalists, focusing instead on tangible technical work.  

The chapter proves more challenging to read than Linus's first-person narratives. As an external observer's perspective, the professional writer's sophisticated syntax and analytical depth demand greater concentration. Positioned at the book's one-seventh mark, however, it signals a transition toward increasingly substantial content, suggesting richer discussions will emerge in subsequent chapters.

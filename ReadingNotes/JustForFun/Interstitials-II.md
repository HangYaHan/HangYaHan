## Comment
This transitional chapter serves as a brief interlude before delving into the book's central narrative - the birth of the operating system. What's particularly noteworthy is Linus's selective memory: while claiming poor recollection of childhood events, he demonstrates remarkable precision when describing technical details like his first computer's exact dimensions, acquisition circumstances, and even the physical appearance of his maternal grandfather (the computer's original owner). This striking contrast underscores how technology serves as the true anchor for his memories, foreshadowing the profound role computing will play in his life story.

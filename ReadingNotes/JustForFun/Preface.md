-- D :  Someone told me that since the dawn of man, there have been two lingering questions. 
        One: “What is the meaning of life?" and 
        Two: "What can I do with all this pocket change that accumulates at the end of the day?"
-- L :  I have the answer to the frst one.

It won't give your life any meaning, but it tells you what's going to happen. There are three things that have meaning for life. They are the motivational factors for everything in your life-for anything that you do or any living thing does: The frst is survival, the second is social order, and the third is entertainment. Everything in life progresses in that order.And there is nothing after entertainment. So, in a sense, the implication is that the meaning of life is to reach that third stage. And once you've reached the third stage, you're done. But you have to go through the other stages first.

I'll give you a few examples so you can kind of get the idea. And the obvious one is sex. It started out as survival, but it became a social thing, That's why you get married. And then it becomes entertainment.

So, if you know that life is all about this progressiothen obviously your purpose in life is to make this progression. And the progression is not one single progression. Everything you do is part of many progressions. It can also be, “What can I do to make society better?” You know that you're a part of society. You know that society is moving in this direction. You can help society move in this direction.

Money is a very powerful motivation at survival level because it surely can buy things to let you survive. 

But as a system, everything is moving in the same direction in spite of not at the same time.
(The direction here probably refers to from survival to social order and then to entertainment.)

## Comment
In this chapter, the author delves into the intricate concept of the meaning of life, providing nuanced insights and poignant examples to elucidate this profound matter.

Firstly, let's consider the profound facet of sex:
- Survival instincts drive the primal essence of human existence.
- The societal institution of marriage signifies the evolution towards social cohesion.
- Ultimately, sex transcends its biological origins to embody a form of entertainment and emotional connection.

Moving on, the discourse shifts towards the profound complexities of war:
- Initially rooted in survival, wars are often waged over essential resources like water or to protect loved ones.
- Establishing social order through the imposition of hierarchy and control, especially prevalent in ancient times.
- The shift towards modernity sees the portrayal of wars as entertainment, watched through the lens of media like television, or even in the form of strategic war games.

Further exemplifying this progression of meaning in life is the realm of technology, exemplified by Linux:
- Survival in the technological realm necessitates the presence of robust operating systems like Linux.
- Geek culture, with individuals engrossed in coding within their cubicles, embodies both entertainment and a unique societal order within the tech community.
- The collaborative nature of tech development underscores the significance of teamwork in advancing technological prowess and societal progress.

In essence, these examples encapsulate the multifaceted nature of life's meaning, ranging from primal instincts to societal structures and the transcendent pursuit of entertainment and progress. Through these diverse lenses, the author navigates the intricate tapestry of human existence, shedding light on the underlying motivations that propel individuals and societies forward on their existential journey.
